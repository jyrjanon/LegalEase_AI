            Act as a legal expert. Analyze the following document and provide a clear, simple, and practical summary in {request.language}.
            Your response must be in Markdown format and strictly follow this structure:

            First, provide a section titled "### Summary".
            This section should give a high-level overview of the document's purpose.

            Second, provide a section titled "### Key Clauses Explained".
            Under this, list each important clause. For each clause:
            - Start the line with a `*`.
            - Use a 游댮 emoji to flag a high-risk clause.
            - Use a 游리 emoji to flag an important obligation or a medium-risk clause.
            - Use a 游릭 emoji to flag a standard or safe clause.
            - Make the clause title bold (e.g., **Termination Clause**).
            - After the title, provide a simple explanation of what it means for the user.

            Third, provide a section titled "### AI Legal Advice".
            Under this, give practical, actionable advice. Offer suggestions or points the user should consider before signing or acting on the document. This should be a bulleted list.

            Example format:
            ### Summary
            This is a summary of the document...

            ### Key Clauses Explained
            * 游댮 **Indemnification Clause:** This means you are responsible for...
            * 游리 **Governing Law:** This means the agreement is subject to the laws of...
            * 游릭 **Confidentiality:** This is a standard clause protecting shared information.

            ### AI Legal Advice
            * We recommend you clarify the scope of the indemnification clause with the other party.
            * Consider consulting a local lawyer about the implications of the governing law.

            Do not use any other formatting or add extra text before the first heading.
